### BYB Project 1
This project serves as to show that I have set up a local git repository and pushed it to my remote repository. 

The only file included inn thsi repository is a very simple python file that prints "Git is Awesome!" to the terminal.

This project was created and is solely maintained by me, billyjroyle.
